#Customer Churn Analysis
##Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the customer churn rate at Telco Base Company and identify the primary reasons behind customer churn.

##Introduction
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. It is a critical metric for businesses to track as it directly impacts revenue and profitability. Understanding the factors contributing to customer churn can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

##Data Analysis
##Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about Telco's customers, including demographics, services availed, contract details, and churn status.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and convert data types where necessary.
Categorical Univariate Analysis: Analyzed various categorical variables such as gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents, etc., to understand their distribution and relationship with churn.
Numerical Univariate Analysis: Examined numerical variables like monthly charges, total charges, tenure, etc., to identify patterns and correlations with churn.
Correlation Analysis: Investigated the correlation between different variables and churn rate to understand their relationship.
Key Insights
Gender: The churn rate among male and female customers is approximately equal.
Senior Citizen: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to non-senior citizens.
Partner and Dependents: Customers without partners and dependents tend to churn more.
Contract Type: Customers with month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those with one-year or two-year contracts.
Payment Method: Customers using electronic check as their payment method exhibit the highest churn rate.
Tenure: Customers with shorter tenure (1-12 months) have a higher churn rate compared to those with longer tenure.
##Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it's evident that several factors contribute to customer churn at Telco Base Company. To mitigate churn and improve customer retention, Telco should focus on understanding customer needs better, offering incentives for long-term contracts, improving service quality, and providing better support to senior citizen customers.

##Next Steps
Further analysis could involve predictive modeling to forecast customer churn and identify proactive strategies to retain customers. Additionally, collecting more granular data on customer interactions and feedback could provide deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences.
